STEP 1: need to join two tables on the column user_id. (you can use LEFT JOIN or INNER JOIN in this instance). LEFT JOIN shows 0 counts for users in this case
STEP 2: filter data where status = 'Completed' 
STEP 3: GROUP BY city and count the number of order_ids there are
STEP 4: ORDER by the COUNT DESC and LIMIT 3 for the TOP 3 cities
