/*Step 1: This shows by company_id, and title the number of duplicate postings since COUNT(*)>=2*/
WITH cte1 as (
select company_id, title, COUNT(*) as count_duplicate_listings
from job_listings
GROUP BY company_id, title
HAVING COUNT(*)>=2
)

/*Step 2: using a common table expression (CTE) which is a temporary table, i stored the above table and just pulled the count from it:*/
select COUNT(count_duplicate_listings) as co_w_duplicate_jobs

/*Final answer (combined):*/
WITH cte1 as (
