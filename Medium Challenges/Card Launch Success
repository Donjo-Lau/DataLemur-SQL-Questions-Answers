/*Step 1: Use RANK window function and PARTITION BY card_name to get the ordering of the most recent issued_amount for each card_name.
IMPORTANT NOTE: we ORDER by issue_year first then issue_month because we want to make sure we get the first issue_year instead of the first_issue_month
because it could be conflicting if we have Jan 2021, Jan 2022, Jan 2023, we are not specific enough if we ordered by month first.
When ordering by year first we pick the year 2021, and then we pick the earliest month which is then Jan.*/
