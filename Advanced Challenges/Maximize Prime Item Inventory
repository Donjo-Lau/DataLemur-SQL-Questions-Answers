--1. find the sum of square_footage, number of items for each of prime_eligible and non_prime_items
WITH cte1 as (
SELECT item_type, 
COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) as num_items,
SUM(square_footage) as total_square_footage,
500000 as warehouse
FROM inventory
GROUP BY item_type
),

--2. get the number of times prime_eligible fits which is 
--500,000/555.2 sqft which is 900 times with a remainder of 320 sqft

cte2 as (
select item_type,total_square_footage, num_items, warehouse, 
FLOOR(warehouse/total_square_footage) as x_prime_items_times, 
warehouse % total_square_footage as remainder
from cte1
WHERE item_type = 'prime_eligible'
),

--3. now take remainder / not_prime sqft which would be 
--320/ 128.5
cte3 as (
select cte1.item_type, cte1.total_square_footage, cte1.num_items,
cte2.remainder,
FLOOR(cte2.remainder/cte1.total_square_footage) as non_prime_items_times
from cte1, cte2
WHERE cte1.item_type = 'not_prime'
)

--4. Combine the two different tables with UNION ALL
select item_type,
cte2.num_items*x_prime_items_times as item_count
FROM cte2
UNION ALL
select item_type, 
cte3.num_items*non_prime_items_times as item_count
from cte3
