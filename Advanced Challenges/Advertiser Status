/*Step 1: table for each advertiser user_id, find the status and amount paid: Find out who pay and did not pay
create another table for each payment user_id with their status and the amount paid: Find out if there's new paid user

Step 2: Use UNION to combine or stack the two tables together to get both tables information into one: 
If paid is null, then that user have not paid at day t and if status is null
then the user is a new user(who's information is not present in advertiser table but that user paid on day t, so this particular user is called as new user)
